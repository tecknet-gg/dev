The group advises that if ICE operatives are conducting an arrest or traffic stop, responders should try to approach within their line of sight and identify themselves in the process.\nYou can also report immigration enforcements sightings in many areas without getting involved by calling a local ICE watch tip line. Many immigration advocacy and human rights groups suggest using the “SALUTE” acronym to guide the information you give in these reports. Size: How many agents or officers you see. Activity: What are they doing? Has anyone been detained? Location: Where exactly did you see them and what direction are they heading in? Units: What types of officers are they or what words and markings can you see on their uniforms? Time: What time was the sighting? Make reports as quickly as possible. Equipment: What do the agents have with them, such as types of weapons, vehicles, crowd control methods, and other details?\nhello # Filming ICE behavior can let agents know they are being watched, potentially creating some accountability for their actions, as well as a digital evidence trail for any legal cases or proceedings that may occur at a later date. When interacting with federal agents as part of a group effort responding to ICE, Siembra NC recommends identifying yourself as a volunteer, and asking agents who they are, what they are doing, and what agency they work for. Then you can state that you will remain present to observe, while also recording any models of vehicles, license plates, and operatives at the scene.\n“We always advise people that if the law enforcement officer that you are filming tells you to step back, you should step back and you should say it out loud—‘I’m stepping back, I’m stepping back.’ That way you’re recording that you’re complying with their order,” Nathan-Pineau says.\nMultiple sources reiterated that recording federal agents has a dual purpose, because if your own behavior and that of the people around you is appropriate to the situation, this will be captured in your documentation as well as any officer misconduct. The fact remains, though, that peacefully filming interactions can be interpreted as aggressive or escalatory precisely because it is an accountability mechanism.\nProximity is one of the most important risks to assess when on the scene, says Xavier de Janon, director of mass self-defense at the National Lawyers Guild. “The closer people have been to federal agents or property, the more likely they’ve been charged, tackled, or arrested,” he says.\nMore and more, federal prosecutors are seeking criminal charges against people for allegedly assaulting federal officers, even if the cases ultimately don’t succeed and later get dropped. The NLG recently published a guide on how protesters and observers can assess risks related to the federal assault law.\n","date":"January 11, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/blog/why-you-need-an-aaron/","section":"The Blog","summary":"Details on why you should buy an aaron.","title":"why you need an aaron","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"January 10, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/blog/blog-2/","section":"The Blog","summary":"blog desc 2","title":"blog 2","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"January 9, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/blog/blog-3-1-1/","section":"The Blog","summary":"blog desc 3","title":"blog 3","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"January 9, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/blog/blog-3-1-2/","section":"The Blog","summary":"blog desc 3","title":"blog 3","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"January 9, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/blog/blog-3-1/","section":"The Blog","summary":"blog desc 3","title":"blog 3","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"January 9, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/blog/blog-3/","section":"The Blog","summary":"blog desc 3","title":"blog 3","type":"blog"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"Book reviews\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/book/","section":"Bookshelf","summary":"","title":"Bookshelf","type":"book"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"Book reviews\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"Book reviews\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/resume/","section":"resume","summary":"","title":"resume","type":"resume"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
