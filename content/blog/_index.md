I see you've stumbled across this blog. Or perhaps this isn't your first time here. Very mysterious. Either way, I welcome you into my humble internet abode. Here I can offer you a tasteful (by personal definition) mixture of posts. You can expect to see some technology, some math, maybe some physics, computer science, engineering-ish posts? What I'm getting to is that I'll  just be writing about stuff that I find cool. If you happen to find the stuff I find cool, cool too, then it might be worth sticking around! If not, I don't blame you...
